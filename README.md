# Retail Analysis
In this analysis, I will use data from retail.csv to do exploratory data analysis. This data contains sales records from a retail company which I named PT. Vards. PT.Vards is a global retail company selling Office Supplies, Furniture and Technology stuff. The buyers come from various segments such as Corporate, Home Office, and individual consumers. This company can also provide the best options for customer delivery according to customer needs.
